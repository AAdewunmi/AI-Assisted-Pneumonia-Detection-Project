Title,Body,Labels,Milestone
Implement batch scoring feature,"Extend Flask backend to handle multiple image uploads. Create a `/batch_upload` route returning a table of predictions for each image.",flask,Week 4
Design batch prediction table in dashboard,"Add a new tab in **dashboard.html** displaying filename, probability, and decision. Allow CSV export of batch results.",frontend,Week 4
Integrate DICOM file handling,"Add optional DICOM support using **pydicom**. Convert `.dcm` files to arrays for model inference while preserving metadata.",data-processing,Week 4
Add DICOM upload toggle in UI,"Update sidebar controls to include 'DICOM mode' checkbox. Adjust upload logic to accept `.dcm` files.",frontend,Week 4
Run bias and slice analysis,"Conduct exploratory bias checks by patient age/sex or acquisition site (if metadata available). Visualize group performance metrics.",analysis,Week 4
Generate bias and limitations report,"Create **docs/bias_limitations.md** summarizing bias analysis results and key ethical considerations.",documentation,Week 4
Optimize model inference speed,"Profile inference time per image. Experiment with model quantization or GPU acceleration where possible.",performance,Week 4
Containerize Flask app with Docker,"Write a **Dockerfile** and `.dockerignore`. Include environment setup, model loading, and port exposure for deployment.",devops,Week 4
Deploy app to Render or Railway,"Deploy containerized Flask app to chosen cloud platform. Validate routes and Grad-CAM overlay generation post-deployment.",deployment,Week 4
Add GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline,"Set up `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to run tests, build Docker image, and trigger deployment on push to main.",ci-cd,Week 4
Create final project README and technical report,"Combine all weeks’ documentation into one polished README with performance summary, usage, and ethical disclaimers.",documentation,Week 4
Record short demo walkthrough,"Capture a 2–3 minute screen recording of dashboard inference and Grad-CAM explanations for LinkedIn/portfolio.",documentation,Week 4
Commit and push all Week 4 artifacts,"Ensure Docker, CI/CD, deployment, and bias analysis updates are committed and pushed. Tag release v1.0 on GitHub.",workflow,Week 4
Refactor data loading pipeline to optimize performance,"Revise **src/data_loader.py** to implement efficient data loading with caching and prefetching. Benchmark load times before and after changes.",data_pipeline,Week 4
Integrate advanced data augmentation techniques,"Incorporate augmentations like CutMix and MixUp in **src/data_loader.py**. Evaluate their impact on model robustness during training.",data-processing,Week 4
Evaluate augmented model performance,"Retrain model with new augmentations and compare metrics (AUC, precision, recall) against previous results. Document findings in **docs/week4_summary.md**.",evaluation,Week 4
Implement unit tests for new features,"Create tests for batch upload, DICOM handling, and Docker setup in **tests/** directory. Ensure coverage with pytest.",testing,Week 4
