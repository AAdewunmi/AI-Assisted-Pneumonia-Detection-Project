    "# Grad-CAM Refinement & Testing (Week 2, Day 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook (`04_gradcam_refinement.ipynb`) extends the PneumoDetect explainability workflow by refining and testing the Grad-CAM implementation introduced in Week 2 Day 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "- Encapsulate Grad-CAM inference in a reusable `generate_cam(image_path, model_path)` function.\n",
    "- Validate reliability and reproducibility with unit and integration tests.\n",
    "- Enhance color rendering using OpenCV’s `COLORMAP_JET`.\n",
    "- Ensure Grad-CAM overlays render consistently across different checkpoints.\n",
    "- Summarize and visualize Grad-CAM results for misclassified examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Summary\n",
    "- **Module Updated:** `src/gradcam.py`\n",
    "- **Tests Added:** `tests/test_gradcam_refinement.py`, `tests/test_gradcam_refinement_integration.py`\n",
    "- **Outputs Saved To:** `reports/week2_gradcam_refinement/`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables\n",
    "- Passing test suite (`pytest`): verifies shape, normalization (0–1), and overlay integrity.\n",
    "- Reliable Grad-CAM visualizations confirming robust explainability."
