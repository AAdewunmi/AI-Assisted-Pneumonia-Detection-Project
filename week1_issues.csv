"Title,Body,Labels,Milestone"
"Set up project repository,""Create new repo **pneumodetect** with standard folder structure, .gitignore, README.md, and requirements.txt. Ensure virtual environment setup instructions are clear."",setup,Week 1"
"Create virtual environment and install dependencies,""Set up Python 3.11 venv or Conda environment. Install torch, torchvision, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, Flask, pytest. Verify import success."",setup,Week 1"
"Explore dataset structure and metadata,""Load RSNA/NIH dataset subset into notebook **01_eda_preprocessing.ipynb**. Inspect columns, image paths, and class distribution."",data,Week 1"
"Visualise class imbalance and image samples,""Plot histogram of pneumonia vs normal labels. Display montage of random X-rays using matplotlib. Document insights in notebook."",data-visualisation,Week 1"
"Implement preprocessing and augmentation pipeline,""Write **src/data_loader.py** to resize (224×224), normalise (ImageNet mean/std), and augment (flip/rotate). Return DataLoader object."",data-processing,Week 1"
"Write unit test for preprocessing pipeline,""Add **tests/test_preprocessing.py** to confirm tensor shape (batch,3,224,224) and no NaNs after transformation. Run pytest."",testing,Week 1"
"Implement baseline ResNet-50 model,""Create **src/model.py** using pretrained ResNet-50 with frozen layers and new classifier head (2 outputs). Include docstrings."",model,Week 1"
"Train baseline model on subset,""Use **src/train.py** to train 3–5 epochs on small dataset. Log loss/accuracy and save weights to **saved_models/resnet50_baseline.pt**."",training,Week 1"
"Evaluate baseline model performance,""In **02_train_resnet50.ipynb**, load saved weights, compute confusion matrix, ROC, precision-recall. Plot metrics."",evaluation,Week 1"
"Document Week 1 results and reflections,""Write **docs/week1_summary.md** summarising dataset, preprocessing, baseline metrics, and initial observations."",documentation,Week 1"
"Commit and push all Week 1 artifacts,""Ensure all scripts, notebooks, tests, and reports are version-controlled and pushed to GitHub main branch."",workflow,Week 1"
